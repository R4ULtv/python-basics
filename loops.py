# LOOPS FOR AND WHILE

for i in range(0,10,1): # {start,stop,step} {if you write range (10) python automatically uses 0 as start, the step is 1 and we insert the stop}
    # the code runs a specific number of loops in range(), you can use i as an index
    print(i)

while True:
    # {the code will continue to cycle as long as the condition is true}
